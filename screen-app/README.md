Screen App - minimal example

This is a tiny Angular example project created to demonstrate how a minimal standalone Angular app would look.

To run locally:

1. Open a terminal in this folder: screen-app
2. Run: npm install
3. Run: npm start

The dev server will start on port 4205 (as configured in package.json).
